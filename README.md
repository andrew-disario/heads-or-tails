<h1>"Heads or Tails?"</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>
In this project, an application was developed that would allow two players to play a game in which each player takes turns calling whether a coin toss will result in a heads or tails where the winner is determined after a certain number of rounds. Using generalized variables, a user can set the number of rounds to be played. When run, both players will be asked to input their names and then each will take turns predicting the outcome of a coin flip. The program records the results, reports the score each turn and will eventually declare the winner or a tie if that is the case. If invalid inputs are ever given, the program will ask again for a valid input instead of crashing.
